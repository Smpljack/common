# NARVAL-II Collaboration repository

This repository is intended to facilitate collaboration between NARVAL-II participants.
It will contain metadata, list with resource links and scripts which help to use the measured data in a consistent manner.

Currently, you can find:

* the ``metadata`` folder, containing a growing collection of metadata
* the ``python`` folder, containing the ``narval_ii`` python package with tools to access data and metadata
* the ``docs`` folder, containing the sources for the web page found at https://d70-t.github.io/narval-ii/
