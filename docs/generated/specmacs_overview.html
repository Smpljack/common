    <h1 class="page-heading">specMACS on NARVAL-II</h1>
    <h2>general remarks</h2>
    Due to the short development time for the specMACS adaption to the downward looking position before the NARVAL-II campaign, some parts of the system were operating suboptimal. Any quick fix during the campaign would have been risky, because taking the system apart and together again needs several days due to the mounting location in the boiler room, which would most likely have affected the flight schedule if done during the campaign. Known issues include the following:
    <ul>
        <li>The environmental control system was not able to keep the window ice-free at all times, lower flight altitudes were chosen during the campaign to partially compensate this issue.</li>
        <li>The Focus of the VNIR system had accidentally been modified. This results in a spatial blur of the data.</li>
        <li>One wire of the VNIR data cable has been damaged, therefore every 2<sup>nd</sup> spatial pixel is unuseable. This luckily coincides with the previous problem.</li>
        <li>The aperture of the 2D camera was too big for the brightest cloudy scenes, which resulted in several overexposure events.</li>
    </ul>
    The above mentioned issues have been fixed for the following campaign (<a href="https://macsserver.physik.uni-muenchen.de/campaigns/NAWDEX/">NAWDEX</a>).

                <li>The system which is responsible for dark current measurements is also responsible for autoexposure.

    <h2>the specMACS instrument</h2>
    specMACS is a hyperspectral imager, capturing one image line at a time. It is sensitive in the range of approx. 400nm to 2500nm and has a field of view of approximately 35&deg;. During NARVAL-II it is mounted on the HALO aircraft facing downwards and is accompanied by a 2D RGB camera an an opening angle of 70&deg;. More information can be found in <a href="http://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/9/2015/2016/amt-9-2015-2016.pdf">Ewald et al. (2016)</a>.
